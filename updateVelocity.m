function [atomsVX, atomsVY] = updateVelocity(atomsVX, atomsVY)
%UpdateVelocity Updates the X and Y velocity components for all involved
%atoms
%   using the velocities, and forces as inputs, we will use the equations
%   of motion to return vectors of the velocities
%   Interacts with the getforces function, and is called in the update
%   position function. this function should also implement the boundary
%   conditions
